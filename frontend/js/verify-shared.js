/* Shared verification maths — one copy for the server and for the browser.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The PONSLOOT promise reads "don't trust us, check for
 * yourself". That is worth something only if the visitor recomputes the result
 * with THEIR OWN code on THEIR OWN machine and arrives at the same number.
 * Which means the whole of the verification maths has to be reachable from the
 * browser — and, at the same time, be the very same maths the server counted
 * with. Two copies of one thing always drift apart; the only question is when.
 *
 * Hence the UMD wrapper: in the browser it lands on globalThis, under Node the
 * server requires it and uses that same copy. Nobody has a version of their
 * own — there is one version.
 *
 * Randomness is derived through Web Crypto rather than node:crypto, because
 * Web Crypto exists in both worlds. The price for that is asynchrony in a
 * place where a synchronous HMAC would have been enough on the server.
