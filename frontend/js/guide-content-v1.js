/* Guide content.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pulled out into its own file on purpose: this is text, not logic, and it
   should be editable without going into game.js and its twenty-eight
   thousand lines.

   The old guide consisted of seventeen one-sentence lines ("Stop moving to
   fire.") and explained none of the mechanics the game rests on: that the
   elements are picked once per run, that the boss carries armour on top of
   its health, that the legendary pity hits on the fiftieth pull. The player
   found all of that out only by losing.

   The order of the sections mirrors the order in which the player runs into
   them: first how to shoot, then what happens between stages, then the
   elements, the enemies, the bosses, and only after that the camp. Within a
   section, the rule that is most often misunderstood comes first.

   The numbers are taken from the code, not invented. If the balance is
   changed, this file is changed too: forest-balance.js for difficulty,
   gacha-system.js for pulls, equipment.js for rarities. */
